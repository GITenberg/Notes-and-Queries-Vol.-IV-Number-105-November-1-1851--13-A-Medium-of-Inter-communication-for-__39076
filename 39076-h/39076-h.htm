<h3>
<span>THE CLAIMS OF LITERATURE.</span>
</h3>


<p>This day two years, on presenting to the public, and to the Literary Men
of England the first number of N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>, as "a medium by which
much valuable information might become a sort of common property among
those who can appreciate and use it," we ventured to say, "We do not
anticipate any holding back by those whose 'Notes' are most worth
having, or any want of 'Queries' from those best able to answer them.
Whatever may be the case in other things, it is certain that those who
are best informed are generally the most ready to communicate knowledge
and to confess ignorance, to feel the value of such a work as we are
attempting, and to understand that, if it is to be well done, they might
help to do it. Some cheap and frequent means for the interchange of
thought is certainly wanted by those who are engaged in Literature, Art,
and Science; and we only hope to persuade the best men in all, that we
offer them the best medium of communication with each other."</p>

<p>How fully these anticipations have been realised, how all the "best men"
<i>have</i> come forward, we acknowledge with feelings of gratitude and
pride. May we now hope that, in thus forming one fresh bond of union
among the lovers and professors of Literature in this country, we have
contributed towards a recognition of Literature as an honorable
profession, and hastened the time when the claims of Literature,
Science, and Art to some of those honorary distinctions hitherto
exclusively conferred upon the Naval, Military, or Civil Servants of the
Crown, will be admitted and acted upon. For as we hold with Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"That he is gentil who doth gentil dedes;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">so we would have those men especially honoured, whose "gentil dedes" in
Literature, Science, and Art tend to elevate the minds, and thereby
promote the happiness of their fellow-men.</p>

<p>That gallant gentleman, Captain Sword, whose good services we readily
acknowledge, has hitherto monopolized all the honours which the
sovereign has thought proper to distribute. We would fain see good
Master Pen now take his fair share of them;<a id="them1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the present moment,
when Peace has just celebrated her Jubilee in the presence of admiring
millions, is surely the fittest moment that could be selected for the
establishment of some Order (call it of Victoria, or Civil Merit, or
what you will) to honour those followers of the Arts of Peace to whose
genius, learning, and skill the great<a id="Page_338"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[338]</span> event of the year 1851 owes
its brilliant conception, its happy execution, its triumphant success.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#them1" class="label">[1]</a>We
 are glad to find that the views we have here advocated,
have the support of the leading journal of Europe. Vide <i>The Times</i> of
Wednesday last.</p>

<p>The reign of the Illustrious Lady who now fills with so much dignity the
Throne of these Realms, has happily been pre-eminently distinguished
(and long may it be so!) by all unexampled progress made in all the Arts
of Peace. Her Majesty has been pre-eminently a Patron of all such Arts.
How graceful then, on the part of Her Majesty, would be the immediate
institution of an Order of Civil Merit! How gratifying to those
accomplished and worthy men on whom Her Majesty might be pleased to
confer it!</p>




<h2>
<span class="bla">Notes.</span>
</h2>


<h3>
<span>DANIEL DEFOE AND THE "MERCATOR."</span>
</h3>


<p>Wilson, in his <i>Life of Defoe</i>, vol. iii. p. 334., gives an account from
Tindal, Oldmixon, Boyer, and Chalmers, of the <i>Mercator</i> and its
antagonist, the <i>British Merchant</i>. He commences by observing that Defoe
"had but little to do with this work" (the <i>Mercator</i>), and quotes
Chalmers, who seems totally to mistake the passage in Defoe's <i>Appeal to
Honour and Justice</i>, pp. 47-50., in which the <i>Mercator</i> is mentioned,
and to consider it as a denial on his part of having had any share in
the work. Defoe's words are&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"What part I had in the <i>Mercator</i> is well known, and would men
   answer with argument and not with personal abuse, I would at any
   time defend any part of the <i>Mercator</i> which was of my writing.
   But to say the <i>Mercator</i> is mine is false. I never was the
   author of it, nor had the property, printing, or profit of it. I
   had never any payment or reward for writing any part of it, nor
   had I the power of putting what I would into it, yet the whole
   clamour fell upon me."</p>

<p class="noindent">Defoe evidently means only to deny that he was the originator and
proprietor of the <i>Mercator</i>, not that he was not the principal writer
in it. The <i>Mercator</i> was a government paper set on foot by Harley to
support the proposed measure of the Treaty of Commerce with France; and
the <i>Review</i>, which Defoe had so long and so ably conducted, being
brought to a close in the beginning of May, 1713, he was retained to
follow up the opinions he had maintained in the <i>Review</i> as to the
treaty in this new periodical. He had not the control of the work
undoubtedly, otherwise, cautiously abstaining as he does himself from
all personal attacks upon his opponents, the remarks on Henry Martin
would not have appeared, which led to a severe and very unjust
retaliation in the <i>British Merchant</i>, in which Defoe's misfortunes are
unfeelingly introduced. There cannot, however, be the slightest doubt to
any one at all acquainted with Defoe's style, or who compares the
<i>Mercator</i> with the commercial articles in the Review, that the whole of
the <i>Mercator</i>, except such portion as appears in the shape of letters,
and which constitutes only a small part of the work, was written by
Defoe. The principal of these letters were probably written by William
Brown.</p>

<p>The excessive rarity of the <i>Mercator</i>, which Wilson could never obtain,
and of which probably very few copies exist, has rendered it the least
known of Defoe's publications. Even Mr. M'Culloch, from the mode in
which he speaks of it (<i>Literature of Political Economy</i>, p. 142.),
would appear not to have seen it. And therefore, whilst the <i>British
Merchant</i>, "the shallow sophisms and misstatements" of which we now
treat with contempt, is one of the most common of commercial books,
having gone through at least three editions, besides the original folio,
the <i>Mercator</i>, replete as it is with the vigour, the life and
animation, the various and felicitous power of illustration, which this
great and truly English author could impart to any subject, still exists
only in probably four or five copies of the original folio numbers. How
many of the advocates for free trade are acquainted with a production in
which one of the most gifted minds that the country ever produced,
exerts his delightful powers and most effectual "unadorned eloquence" in
the support of their favourite doctrine?</p>

<p>I do not see any copy of the <i>Mercator</i> noticed in the printed catalogue
of the British Museum. I owe my own to the kindness of
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>, who allowed me to possess it, having purchased it, I believe, at
Mr. Heber's sale.</p>

England</i>, that historical accuracy has been sacrificed in representing
Henry V., on his accession, to have re-invested Sir William Gascoigne
with "the balance and the sword." Lord Campbell, warned that
chroniclers, historians, moralists, and poets had, without historical
warrant, taken for true the story which Shakspeare has made so familiar
to us, has, in his <i>Lives of the Chief Justices</i>, examined the evidence
for attributing to the young king the act of magnanimity, and has
affirmed (vol. i. p. 131.) not only that Sir William committed the
prince, but that he actually filled the office of Chief Justice under
him when he became Henry V. The noble and learned lord has been at some
pains to authenticate the story of the commital of the prince, and has
shown that there is no sufficient reason for disbelieving that the
dauntless judge did make "princely power submit" to justice; and he has
brought forward also the probable sources of Shakspeare's information.
But these are silent as to the reinstatement of the illustrious judge;
and <a id="Page_339"></a>  <span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">OSS</span> has established that the young king lost no time in
dispensing with the "well-practised wise directions" of Sir William
Gascoigne. One is really sorry to be obliged to relinquish belief in the
historical foundation of the scene to which Shakspeare has given such
fine dramatic effect in his noble lines. My object, however, in now
writing is to point out a circumstance in some respects parallel, which
occurred in the reign of Edward I. In looking thorough the <i>Abbreviatio
Placitorum</i> to-day, I find the record of a judgment in Michaelmas Term,
33 Edw. I. (1305), in which a curious illustration is given of the
character of that sovereign; for it appears that Edward Prince of Wales
having spoken words insulting to one of the king's ministers (when and
to whom I wish I could ascertain), the monarch himself firmly vindicated
the respect due to the royal dignity in the person of its servants, by
banishing the prince from his house and presence for a considerable
time. This anecdote occurs in the record of a complaint made to the king
in council, by Roger de Hecham (in Madox the name occurs as Hegham or
Heigham), a Baron of the Exchequer, of gross and upbraiding language
having been contemptuously addressed to him by William de Brewes,
because of his judgment in favour of the delinquent's adversary. The
record recites that such contempt and disrespect towards as well the
king's ministers as himself or his courts are very odious to the king,
and proceeds&mdash;&mdash; but I will give the original:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Que quidem (videlicet) contemptus et inobediencia tam ministris
   ipsius Domini Regi quam sibi ipsi aut cur' suæ facta ipsi Regi
   valde sunt odiosa, et hoc expresse nuper apparuit idem Dñs Rex
   filium suum primogenitum et carissimum Edwardum Principem Walliæ

<p>And accordingly the said Edward was adjudged to go in full court in
Westminster Hall, and ask pardon of the judge whom he had insulted; and
for the contempt done to the king and his court was then to stand
committed to the Tower, there to remain during the king's pleasure.

<h3>
<span title="[Greek: Adelphos]">NOTE ON THE
WORD "&#913;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;."</span>
</h3>


<p>I have attempted to ascertain the <i>primary</i> signification of the word
"<span title="[Greek: adelphos]">&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>," for the purpose of laying down a rule for its right
interpretation in the sacred scriptures. If I have succeeded, we may be
enabled to understand rightly one or two disputed passages in the New
Testament, of which I hope to treat in a subsequent number.</p>

<p>Thus says Scapula on the word:</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "<span title="[Greek: Adelphos]">&#913;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>,
frater propriè, frater uterinus; fit enim a
   dictione <span title="[Greek: delphys]">&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#965;&#962;</span>, uterus;
 et <span title="[Greek: a]">&#945;</span> significante
   <span title="[Greek: homou]">&#959;&#956;&#959;&#965;</span>,
pro <span title="[Greek: homodelphos]">&#959;&#956;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>."</p>


<p class="noindent">His etymology, as far as it goes, is quite correct: but still, we must
trace its different parts up to the fountain-head, in order to
understand the word aright. Let us then first take away its prefix
<span title="[Greek: a]">&#945;</span>, and its constructive affix
<span title="[Greek: os]">&#959;&#962;</span>, and the remaining
<span title="[Greek: delph]">&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;</span> will be found to be a compound word, derived from the
Sanscrit language, proving its identity therewith by means of the
intermediate Semitic dialects.</p>

<p>Chaldee <i>dul</i>, situla, urna, <i>a vessel</i> for holding liquor. Arabic
<i>dal</i>, a fat <i>woman</i>. These primary steps lead us to a passage in Isaiah
li. 1., "the <i>hole</i> of the <i>pit</i>:" where the <i>idea</i> (not the word) is
contained, and forms a connecting link between the Chaldee and Sanscrit;
where, by taking <i>t</i> for <i>d</i> (a letter of the same organ), we have
Sanscrit <i>tal</i>, a <i>hole</i>, <i>pit</i>, cause, origin, &amp;c.; <i>talla</i>, a young
woman, <i>reservoir</i>, <i>pit</i>, &amp;c.; Greek (from the Syriac)
<span title="[Greek: talitha]">&#964;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#952;&#945;</span>, a damsel, Mark v. 41.; and by
 affixing the Sanscrit <i>pha</i>, or
<i>pa</i>, <i>fruitfulness</i>, nourishment, drink, &amp;c., we get <i>talpa</i>, a wife,
bed, &amp;c. Hebrew <i>dalaph</i>, stillavit. Syriac <i>dalpha</i>, conjunctio
venerea. Delilah, a proper name, Judges xvi. 4. We thus ascertain that
<span title="[Greek: del-ph]">&#948;&#949;&#955;-&#966;</span> relates to the fruit or fruitfulness, &amp;c. of the womb:
and by putting the constructive affix
<span title="[Greek: ys]">&#965;&#962;</span> = the Sanscrit <i>as</i> or
<i>us</i>, we have
<span title="[Greek: delphys]">&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#965;&#962;</span>, uterus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We now come to the most important part of the compound
<span title="[Greek: adelphos]">&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>, viz.
 the Sanscrit <span title="[Sanscrit [=a]]">&#257;</span> =
<span title="[Greek: homou]">&#959;&#956;&#959;&#965;</span>, simul, at the same
time; and we find that this <span title="[Sanscrit [=a]]">&#257;</span> refers us to "a limit conclusive" (to
<i>that</i> place, to that time), and also to a "limit inceptive" (<i>from</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">THAT</span> <i>place</i>, from that time); consequently, the <i>primary</i> meaning of
<span title="[Greek: a-del-ph-os]">&#945;-&#948;&#949;&#955;-&#966;-&#959;&#962;</span>, is what Scapula has defined it to be, "frater
uterinus," a brother <i>to</i>, or <i>from the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">SAME</span> <i>womb</i>.</p>

<p>My deduction from hence is, that where the context, or history, does
<i>not</i> point us to a more general sense of the word, <i>i.e.</i> to relatives
such as cousins, or to the whole <i>human</i> race adopting the same term;
<i>correct</i> criticism seems to demand the signification of the word in its
<i>primary</i> meaning.</p>

<h3>
<span>LAMBERT, THE "ARCH-REBELL."</span>
</h3>

<p>Mr. Hallam (<i>Const. Hist.</i>, vol. ii. p. 26. ed. 1850), after some
remarks on the execution of Vane, who was brought to trial together with
Lambert in 1661, asserts that the latter, "whose submissive<a id="Page_340"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[340]</span> behaviour had furnished a contrast with that of Vane, was sent to
Guernsey, and remained a prisoner for thirty years." Mr. Hallam does not
quote his authority for this statement, which I also find in the older
biographical dictionaries. There exists, however, in the library of the
Plymouth Athenæum, a MS. record which apparently contradicts it. This is
a volume called <i>Plimmouth Memoirs, collected by James Yonge</i>, 1684. It
contains "a Catalogue of all the Mayors, together with the memorable
occurrences in their respective years," beginning in 1440. Yonge himself
lived in Plymouth, and the later entries are therefore made from his own
knowledge. There are two concerning Lambert:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"1667. <i>Lambert, the arch-rebell, brought prisoner to this
   Iland."</i></p>


<p class="noindent">[The Island of St. Nicholas at the entrance of the harbour, fortified
from a very early period.]</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "1683, Easter day. My Lord Dartmouth arrived in Plimm<span class="topnum">o</span>. from
   Tangier. In March, Sir G. Jeffry, the famously [Query,
   <i>infamously</i>] loyal Lord Chief Justice, came hither from
   Launceston assize: lay at the Mayor's: viewed y<span class="topnum">e</span> citadells,
   M<span class="topnum">t</span>. Edgecumbe, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The winter of this yeare proved very seveare. East wind, frost,
   and snow, continued three moneths: so that ships were starved in
   the mouth of the channell, and almost all the cattel famisht.
   Y<span class="topnum">e</span> fish left y<span class="topnum">e</span> coast almost 5 moneths. All provisions
   excessive deare; and had we not had a frequent supply from y<span class="topnum">e</span>
   East, corne would have been at 30<span class="topnum">s</span>. per bushell,&mdash;above
   130,000 bushells being imported hither, besides what went to
   Dartm<span class="topnum">o</span>., Fowy, &amp;c.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The Thames was frozen up some moneths, so that it became a small
   citty, with boothes, coffee houses, taverns, glasse houses,
   printing, bull-baiting, shops of all sorts, and whole streetes
   made on it. The birdes of the aire died numerously. <i>Lambert,
   that olde rebell, dyed this winter on Plimm<span class="topnum">o</span>. Island, where he
   had been prisoner 15 years and mo.</i>"</p>


<p>The trial of Lambert took place in 1661. He may have been sent at first
to Guernsey, but could only have remained there until removed in 1667 to
Plymouth. His imprisonment altogether lasted twenty-one years.</p>

<p>Lambert's removal to Plymouth has, I believe, been hitherto unnoticed.
Probably it was thought a safer (and certainly, if he were confined in
the little island of St. Nicholas, it was a severer) prison than
Guernsey.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE CAXTON COFFER.</span>
</h3>

<p>An opinion prevails that biographers who lived nearest the times of the
individuals whom they commemorate are most entitled to belief, as having
at command the best sources of information. To this rule, however, there
are numerous exceptions; for time, which casts some facts into oblivion,
also produces fresh materials for historians and biographers.</p>

<p>It is certainly advisable to <i>consult</i> the earliest memoir of an
individual in whose fate we take an interest, and even each successive
memoir, in order that we may trace the more important historical
particulars, and such critical opinions as seem to require discussion,
to their true source. The result of some comparisons of this
description, on former occasions, has almost led me to consider
biographers as mere copyists&mdash;or, at the best, artists in patch-work. I
shall now compare, on one point, the earlier biographers of Caxton:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Gvilhelmus Caxton, Anglus&mdash;habitavit interim in Flandria 30
   annis cum domina Margareta Burgundiæ ducissa regis Edwardi
   sorore."&mdash;Joannes B<span class="smcap lowercase">ALE</span>, 1559.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Gvilhelmvs Caxtonus, natione Anglus. Vir pius, doctus, etc. In
   Flandria quidem triginta annis vixit cum Margareta Burgundiæ
   duce, regis Edwardi quarti sorore."&mdash;Joannes P<span class="smcap lowercase">ITSEUS</span>, 1619.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "William Caxton, born in that town [sc. Caxton!]. He had most of
   his <i>education</i> beyond the seas, living 30 years in the court of
   Margaret dutchesse of Burgundy, sister to king Edward the Fourth,
   whence I conclude him an Anti-Lancastrian in his
   affection."&mdash;Thomas F<span class="smcap lowercase">ULLER</span>, 1662.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"William Caxton&mdash;was a menial servant, for thirty years together,
   to Margaret dutchess of Burgundy, sister to our king Edward IV.,
   in Flanders."&mdash;William N<span class="smcap lowercase">ICOLSON</span>, 1714.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Gulielmus Caxton natus in sylvestri regione Cantiae; in
   Flandria, Brabantia, Hollandia, Zelandia xxx annis cum domina
   Margareta, Burgundiae ducissa, regis Edwardi IV. sorore
   vixit."&mdash;Thomas T<span class="smcap lowercase">ANNERUS</span>, 1748.</p>


<p>Now, according to Fabian, Stow, and others, Margaret of York was married
to Charles duke of Burgundy in 1468; and if Caxton did not return to
England about the year 1471, as Stow asserts, he was certainly
established at Westminster in 1477. The <i>thirty</i> years of the learned
writers must therefore be reduced to less than <i>ten</i> years!</p>

<p>The discrepancy between these writers, on another important point, is
not less remarkable than their agreement in error, as above-described.
Pits says Caxton flourished in 1483; Fuller, that he died in 1486; and
Tanner, that he <i>flourished</i> about 1483, and <i>died</i> in 1491. Shakspere
died in 1616: in what year did he flourish?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>A Hint to Catalogue Makers.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Among the many excellent schemes proposed
for the arrangement and diffusion of common means of information, one
simple one appears to have been passed over by your many and excellent
correspondents. I will briefly illustrate an existing deficiency by an
example.<a id="Page_341"></a>  <span class="pagenum">[341]</span></p>

<p>While collecting materials for a projected critical commentary on the
<i>Timæus</i> of Plato, I was surprised to find the commentary of
<i>Chalcidius</i> wholly wanting in our library at Christ Church.
Subsequently (when I did not want it, having secured a better edition at
the end of Fabricius' <i>Hippolytus</i>) I discovered a fine copy of Badius
Ascensius' editio princeps, bound up with Aulus Gellius and Macrobius,
but utterly ignored in the Christ Church catalogue.</p>

<p>This instance shows the necessity of carefully examining the <i>insides</i>
of books, as well as the backs and title-pages, during the operation of
cataloguing. Our public libraries are rich in instances of a similar
oversight, and many an important and <i>recherché</i> work is unknown, or
acquires a conventional rarity, through its concealment at the end of a
less valuable, but more bulky, treatise.</p>

<p>I have been aroused to the propriety of publishing this suggestion, by
purchasing, "dog cheap", a volume labelled <i>Petrus Crinitus</i>, but
containing <i>Hegesippus</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the pseudo-Ambrosian translation from
Josephus) and the Latin grammarians at the end, all by the
afore-mentioned printer.</p>

<h3><span>BISHOP BRAMHALL AND MILTON.</span></h3>

<p>Perhaps I am convicting myself of the most benighted ignorance by asking
some of your learned correspondents to elucidate for me a letter of
Bramhall's, which I extract from his works. It was written to his son
from Antwerp, and relates to the early years of our great Milton at
Cambridge, dated:</p>



  <p class="right1"> "Antwerpe, May. 9/19, 1654.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "That lying abusive book [viz., the <i>Def. Pop. Ang.</i>] was written
   by Milton himself, one who was sometime Bishopp Chappell's pupil
   in Christ Church in Cambridge, but turned away by him, as he well
   deserved to have been, out of the University, and out of the
   society of men. If Salmasius his friends knew as much of him as
   I, they would make him go near to hang himself. But I desire not
   to wound the nation through his sides, yet I have written to him
   long since about it roundly. It seems he desires not to touch
   upon this subject."&mdash;<i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 94, Oxford, 1842.</p>

<p>That Milton was <i>rusticated</i> from Cambridge, and besides flogged by Dr.
Chappell, there seems little reason to doubt, but it is equally clear
that the punishment was only a temporary one, as he again went into
residence, and took the degrees of bachelor and master of arts in due
course. Whence, then, this sweeping accusation of the great and good
Bramhall's, whose character is a sufficient safeguard that he at all
events <i>believed</i> what he said? Aubrey relates the story of Milton's
being whipped by Dr. Chappell, and afterwards being "transferred to the
tuition of one Dr. Tovell, who dyed parson of Lutterworth."<a id="worth2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Milton
himself (<i>Elegiarum Liber, Eleg. I. ad Carolum Deodatum</i>) speaks of his
residence in London, and alludes, rather gratefully, to his "exilium"
from Cambridge, which he heartily disliked. He also alludes to his being
flogged, as there seems a whole world of meaning in <i>Cæteraque</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p>"Nec duri libet usque minas perferre magistri,</p>
     <p><i>Cæteraque ingenio non subeunda meo</i>.</p>
     <p>Si sit hoc <i>exilium</i> patrios adiisse penates,</p>
     <p>Et vacuum curis otia grata sequi,</p>
     <p>Non ego vel <i>profugi</i> nomen, sortemve recuso,</p>
     <p>Lætus et <i>exilii</i> conditione fruor."&mdash;Ver. 15. &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#worth2" class="label">[2]</a> Dr. Warton
 has given a long note on the word <i>Cæteraque</i> in
his edition of Milton's <i>Poems</i>, 1791, p. 421. He suggests that probably
"Dr. Tovell" should read "Dr. <i>Tovey</i>, parson of <i>Kegworth</i>, in
Leicestershire."</p>

<p class="noindent">We then get a short sketch of his employments and amusements in London;
and his return to<a id="Page_342"></a>  <span class="pagenum">[342]</span> Cambridge
 is mentioned in the palinode to the
last of his elegies:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p>"Donec Socraticos umbrosa academia rivos</p>
     <p>Præbuit, admissum dedocuitque jugum.</p>
     <p>Protinus extinctis ex illo tempore flammis,</p>
     <p>Cincta rigent multo pectora nostra gelu."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Having now cleared my way in as brief a manner as possible, I must
profess my utter disbelief in the enormities of Milton's life at
Cambridge. He was certainly flogged, but then he was only eighteen years
old at the time, and we know that flogging was permitted by the statutes
of many colleges, and was a favorite recreation amongst the deans,
tutors, and censors of the day. Bramhall's letter has indeed been a
marvellous stumbling-block in my way, ever since the appearance of the
last edition of his works; but I do hope that some of your learned
correspondents will dispel the clouds and shadows that surround me, and
prove that, at all events, Milton was not worse than his neighbours.</p>

<p>Dr. South and Cowley were never flogged at college, but certainly they
were often flogged at school, or they could not speak so feelingly on
the subject:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Those 'plagosi Orbilii' (writes South), those executioners,
   rather than instructors of youth; persons fitted to lay about
   them in a coach or cart, or to discipline boys before a Spartan
   altar, or rather upon it, than to have anything to do in a
   Christian school. I would give these pedagogical <i>Jehus</i>, those
   furious school-drivers, the same advice which the poet says
   Ph&oelig;bus gave his son Phaëton (just such another driver as
   themselves), that he should <i>parcere stimulis</i> (the stimulus in
   driving being of the same use formerly that the lash is now).
   Stripes and blows are the last and basest remedy, and scarce ever
   fit to be used but upon such as carry their brains in their
   backs, and have souls so dull and stupid as to serve for little
   else but to keep their bodies from putrefaction."&mdash;<i>Sermon upon
   Proverbs, xxii. 6.</i></p>


<p class="noindent">And Cowley, in describing the <i>Betula</i> (Angl. birch-tree), how he does
paint from nature!</p>

<p>That Milton's character was notorious or infamous at Cambridge has
never, to my knowledge, been proved; and there is in his favour this
most overwhelming testimony, that he never forfeited the esteem and
friendship of the great and good. Was Sir Henry Wotton writing to a man
of blighted and blasted reputation when he sent the kind and
complimentary letter prefixed to <i>Comus</i>? In that he not merely
eulogises the "Dorique delicacy" of Milton's songs and odes, but gives
him much kind and considerate advice upon the course he was to pursue in
his travels, as well as some introductions to his own friends, and
promises to keep up a regular correspondence with him during his
absence. Milton was very proud of this letter, and speaks of it in his
<i>Defensio Secunda</i>. Again, Milton's associates at Cambridge must have
known all about the misdemeanour (whatever it was) that caused his
rustication, and yet they permitted him to take a part in, and perhaps
to write the preface of, the ever memorable volume which contained the
first edition of <i>Lycidas</i>.</p>

<p>The person commemorated was Edward King, a Fellow of Christ's College,
Cambridge (Milton's own college); and I need not adduce Milton's
affecting allusions to their close and intimate friendship. It was for
another of the <i>Fellows</i> of Christ's College that Milton at the age of
nineteen (the very year after his rustication) wrote the academic
exercise <i>Naturam non pati Senium</i>, found amongst his Latin poems. But I
will omit a great many arguments of a similar kind, and ask this
question, Why has Milton's college career escaped the lash of three of
the most sarcastic of writers, Cleveland, Butler, and South, who were
his contemporaries? Cleveland must have known him well, as he, as well
as Milton, had contributed some memorial verses to King, and party
feeling would perhaps have overcome collegiate associations. Nor could
their mutual connexion with <i>Golden Grove</i> have saved him from the
aspersions of Butler. After the Restoration, Richard Lord Vaughan, Earl
of Carbery, appointed the author of <i>Hudibras</i> to the stewardship of
Ludlow Castle; and his second wife was the Lady Alice Egerton, who, at
the age of thirteen, had acted the Lady in Milton's <i>Comus</i>. It was to
her likewise that Bishop Jeremy Taylor dedicated the third edition of
the third part of the <i>Life of Christ</i>, as he had dedicated the first
edition to Lord Carbery's former wife, whose funeral sermon he preached.
I do not remember that Cleveland or Butler have on any occasion
satirised Milton; but I do remember that Dr. South has done so, and I
cannot understand his silence on the matter if Milton's private
character had been notorious. Of course I do not believe the anonymous
invective ascribed to a son of Bishop Hall's. Dr. South was not the man
to "mince matters," and yet Milton's college life has escaped his
sarcasms. What his opinion of Milton was we may learn from his sermon
preached before King Charles II. upon Judges xix. 30.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE SEMPILLS OF BELTRUS: ROBERT SEMPILL.</span>
</h3>


<p>Some few months ago there was published in Edinburgh the first collected
and only complete edition of the <i>Poems</i> by the three brothers "Sir
James, Robert, and Francis Sempill of Beltrus," better known as the
authors of "The Pack-Man's Paternoster; or, a Picktooth for the Pope,"
"The Life and Death of Habbie Simson, Piper of Kilbarchum," "The
Blythsome Wedding," "Maggie Lauder," &amp;c., with biographical notices of
their lives. I am now anxious to know if any of your numerous
correspondents can inform me if copies of the original editions of the
<i>Poems</i> by "Robert Sempill" can be procured, or if they are in any of
the public or private libraries in England? The following are what I am
in quest of, viz.:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Regentis Tragedie</i>, 1570.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Bischoppis Lyfe and Testament</i>, 1571.</p>

<p>3. <i>My Lorde Methwenis Tragedie</i>, 1572.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Sege of the Castel of Edinburgh</i>, 1573.</p>

<p>Also where any notice as to his family, life, and character can be
found.</p>

<p>A collection of Sempill's <i>Poems</i>, with some authentic account of the
author, is certainly a desideratum in Scottish literature.</p>

<h3>
<span>DESCENDANTS OF JOHN OF GAUNT.</span>
</h3>


<p>John of Gaunt, by his third wife Katharine Swynford, left four children,
born before his marriage with her, but legitimated by act of parliament.
Of these the eldest is thus mentioned in Burke's "Introduction" to the
<i>Peerage</i>, p. xxi.:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "John de Beaufort, <i>Marquess</i> of Somerset and Dorset, who married
   Margaret, daughter of Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent, and had a son
   John, <i>Duke</i> of Somerset, whose <i>only daughter and heir</i>,
   Margaret, married Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, and was mother
   of Henry VII."</p>


<p>Query, Was Margaret "only child," as well as only daughter of John Duke
of Somerset? or was she not sister to Henry, Edmund, and John,
successively Dukes of Somerset? (See Burke's <i>Peerage</i>, "Duke of
Beaufort.")</p>

<p>In that case, after the death of this last-named Duke John issueless,
she would become "sole heir," as she had always been "sole daughter," of
Duke John the First.</p>

<p>Or was she in fact <i>the daughter of this second and last Duke John</i>? At
his death the male line of Lancaster became extinct; the royal branch
having already failed at the death of Henry VI.</p>

<p>There appears some little confusion in Burke's excellent work, as may be
seen by comparing p. xxi. of the Introduction, &amp;c., with the genealogy
of the Beaufort family.</p>

<h4>
<span>246. <i>Rocky Chasm near Gaëta: Earthquake at the Crucifixion.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Dr.
Basire (who was archdeacon of Northumberland, prebendary of Durham, and
chaplain to King Charles the Martyr and King Charles II.), in his
account of a tour made by himself and companions in 1649, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Wee landed to see Gaëta, a pleasant, strong, and very antient
   citty. In it we saw some wonders, especially the thorow rupture
   of a rocky mountain by an earthquake, which tradition sayes, and
   Cardinal Baronius publishes to have happened at our Savior's
   passion: a stupendous sight it is however, and well worth our
   digression."&mdash;<i>Correspondence, &amp;c., of Basire</i>, edited by the
   Rev. W. N. Darnell, p. 90.</p>

<p>I cannot here consult Baronius, to see whether he gives any references,
and should be very glad to be referred to any ancient historian who has
noticed the event to which this remarkable chasm is attributed, and to
know whether the tradition is preserved by any classical writer. I do
not find the chasm in question described by any naturalist, or other
traveller, whose writings I have been able to refer to. It is in a
locality which abounds with indications of volcanic action. It is said
that the Monte Somma was probably not distinct from the present cone of
Vesuvius prior to the great eruption in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 79. In Dr. Daubeny's
<i>Description of Active and Extinct Volcanos</i>, mention is made of an
ancient town beneath the town of Sessa, where a chamber with antique
frescoes and the remains of an amphitheatre were disinterred, of the
overwhelming of which there is no record, nor is there even a tradition
of any eruption having occurred near it in the memory of man.</p>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent MR. W. H. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ESLEDEN</span>, in his

made use of the word <i>cavalcade</i> in reference to that which would
otherwise appear to be a walking procession. He will oblige me (and I
dare say others of your readers) by explaining whether the procession
was really equestrian, or whether he has any authority for the
application of the term to pedestrians. The use of the word cannot have
been a mere oversight, since it is repeated. The relation in which it
stands makes it very doubtful whether it can, by any possibility, be
intended to describe a riding party. If, by any latitude, the word may
be otherwise applied, an authority would<a id="Page_344"></a>

<h4>
<span>250. <i>Seventeenth of November: Custom.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;When at school at Christ's
Hospital, many years ago, a curious custom prevailed on the 17th
November respecting which I had not then sufficient curiosity to
inquire.</p>

<p>Two or more boys would take one against whom they had any spite or
grudge, and having lifted him by the arms and legs would bump him on the
hard stones of the cloisters.</p>

<p>I have often, since I left the school, wondered what could be the origin
of this practice, and more especially as the day was recognised as
having some connexion with Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In reading, "Sir Roger de Coverley" with notes by Willis, published in
the <i>Traveller's Library</i>, I find at p. 134. what I consider a fair
explanation. A full account is there given of the manner in which the
citizens of London intended to celebrate, in 1711, the anniversary of
Queen Elizabeth's accession on 17th November; some parts of which would
almost seem to have been copied during the excitement against the papal
bull in November 1850.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that originally the unfortunate boy who had to
endure the rude bumping by his schoolfellows was intended to represent
the pope or one of his emissaries, and that those who inflicted the
punishment were looked upon as good Protestants.</p>

<p>Is there any other school where this day is celebrated; and if so, what
particular custom prevails there?</p>

<p>The boys always attended morning service at Christ Church on this day.</p>

<h4>
<span>251. <i>Chatter-box.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;The derivation of this word would seem very plain,
and yet I have some doubts about it. I used to think that we called a
person a "chatter-box" because he or she was, metaphorically speaking, a
box full of chatter, as we should call another person a <i>bag-of-bones</i>.
And this seemed confirmed by the German <i>plaudertasche</i>, or a
<i>chatter-bag</i>, till I learnt from Wackernagel, <i>Glossar</i>, that in the
Middle High German <i>Tasche</i> = <i>a woman</i>. (See under "Flattertasche.") I
believe we meet with the word again in the epithet <i>Maultasche</i> applied
to the celebrated Margaret Maultasche, the wife of Louis the Elder;
<i>i.e.</i> Margaret, the woman with the large mouth. The word also occurs in
the Danish <i>Taske</i> = <i>a girl</i>, <i>a wench</i>. Hence, I conclude that there
is no doubt but that the German <i>plaudertasche</i> means a chattering
woman. Has our <i>chatter-box</i> the same meaning&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> is there a word
for <i>woman</i> or <i>female</i> in any of our ancient languages from which <i>box</i>
might arise? The only word which occurs to me just now as confirming
such a supposition is <i>buxom</i> ("to be bonere and buxom, in bedde and at
borde." Ancient Matrimony Service), which is thus = <i>womanly</i>.</p>

<h4>
<span>252. <i>Printing in 1449, and Shakspeare.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As the <i>Esil</i> controversy
seems now, if not settled, to be at least lulled, at the risk of
stirring up another Shakspearean discussion, I venture to set down a
passage in the <i>Second Part of Henry VI.</i>, which I have never yet seen
satisfactorily explained. It is&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Act IV. Scene 7.&mdash;<i>Cade.</i> ... Thou has most traitorously
   corrupted the youth of the realm, in erecting a grammar-school;
   and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other books but the
   score and the tally, <i>thou hast caused printing to be used</i>; and
   contrary to the king, his crown and dignity, <i>thou hast built a
   paper-mill</i>."</p>

<p>Is this a mere wilful anachronism on Shakspeare's part; or had "that
misunderstood politician" Mr. John Cade any ground for this particular
accusation against the Lord Treasurer Say? Perhaps some of your
correspondents who have contributed the very interesting Notes on Caxton

<h4>
<span>253. <i>Texts before Sermons.</i></span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;What is the origin of, and the authority
for our present use of texts of Holy Scripture before sermons? In the
Roman Catholic church the custom, I believe, is not the same. The
homilies used in the Church of England have no texts. In the ancient
Postils, was the gospel for the day again read from the pulpit, or were
the hearers supposed to carry it in their minds? It is quite clear that
texts are now in most cases merely the pegs whereon the sermon is hung,
so to speak, and are not read as passages of Holy Scripture to be
expounded to an audience ignorant of the meaning of the sacred volume.
Perhaps this Query may draw forth some remarks on the subject.</p>

<span><i>Effigy of a Pilgrim.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;There is in the parish church of
Ashby-de-la-Zouch an effigy, which is very interesting from its extreme
rarity; it is placed under a depressed arch in the north wall of the
interior of the edifice, and consists of a recumbent figure of a pilgrim
habited in a cloak and short boots, which lace in front with six holes
just above the instep: his legs are bare, and so is his head, but his
cockle hat lies under his right shoulder; his scrip, hanging from his
right shoulder to his left side, is tolerably perfect; but his row of
beads, suspended from his left shoulder to his right side, is mutilated,
as is also his staff; the hands, which were probably raised in prayer,
are gone; a collar of SS. hangs from his neck (will this be of any use
to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> E. F<span class="smcap lowercase">OSS</span>, Vol. iv., p. 147.?); the feet of the pilgrim rest

<p>&mdash;Presuming that the authors of the Church
Homilies are well known, their writings having been adopted by our
church, and set forth and enjoined by authority to be read in all
churches, I fear I am only showing great ignorance by asking where I can
meet with a list of the writers of those discourses, distinguishing
which of the Homilies were written by each author; and if the writers of
some of them be unknown, then I should be glad to have the names of such
as are known, and the particular Homilies which were written by them.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">[Carwithen, in his <i>History of the Church of England</i>, vol. i. p.
   221. note <i>g</i>, speaking of the first book of Homilies, says,
   "These Homilies were the work of Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,
   Hopkins, and Becon, one of Cranmer's chaplains. There is little
   but internal evidence by which the author of any particular
   Homily can be ascertained. The Homily 'Of the Salvation of
   Mankind,' being the third as they are now placed, was ascribed by
   Gardiner to Cranmer; and Cranmer never denied that it was his.
   The eleventh, in three parts, is by Becon; and it is printed
   among his works published by himself in three volumes folio. It
   is in the second volume." Consult also Le Bas' <i>Life of Cranmer</i>,

<span><i>Family of Hotham of Yorkshire.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;The family of Hotham, or Hothum, of
Boudeby in Yorkshire, acquired large possessions in Kilkenny at an early
period, apparently in consequence of an intermarriage with the Le
Despencers, lords of a third of the liberty of Kilkenny. Can any reader
of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" supply me with a pedigree of that family,
especially as connecting therewith Sir John Hotham, Bishop of Ossory,
1779-1782? Any particulars respecting the life of that prelate will also
be thankfully acknowledged: he is said to have been a member of an old
Yorkshire family. (Cotton's <i>Fasti Ecclesiæ Hibernicæ</i>, vol. ii. p.

<p class="blockquot">[Mr. Akerman, in his very useful <i>Numismatic Manual</i>, p. 227.,
   says, "The word <i>sceatta</i> is by some derived from <i>sceat</i>, a
   <i>part</i> or <i>portion</i>. Professor White, in a paper read to the
   Ashmolean Society, remarks, that it is of M&oelig;so-Gothic origin,
   <i>scatt</i> signifying in the Gospels of Uphilas a <i>pound</i>, a
   <i>penny</i>, and, indeed, money in general." Ruding observes that,
   "Whatever might have been the precise value of the <i>sceatta</i>, it
   was undoubtedly the smallest coin known among the Saxons at the
   latter end of the seventh century, as appears from its forming
   part of a proverb: Ne sceat ne scilling, <i>From the least to the
   greatest</i>."]</p>

<h3>
<span>MARRIAGE OF ECCLESIASTICS.<br />
(Vol. iv. pp. 57. 125. 193. 196. 298.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Your general readers have reason to be as much obliged as myself to your
correspondents C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span>
and<a id="Page_347"></a>  <span class="pagenum">[347]</span>  K. S. for the information contained in
the former's criticisms, and the latter's addition to what you had
inserted in my name on the subject of clerical marriages.</p>

<p>C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> is very fair, for he does not find fault with other persons'
versions of the first part of Heb. xiii. 4. without giving his own
version to be compared; and he states the ground of his criticisms on my
reference to it. He has kindly told your readers, what they might have
conjectured from the Italics in our authorized version, that in
rendering
<span title="[Greek: Timios ho gamos en pasi]">&#932;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8001; &#947;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span>,
"Marriage <i>is</i> honourable in
all," they inserted <i>is</i>; and to show your readers an example of keeping
closer to the original, he himself renders it as follows: "Let (the laws
of) marriage be revered in all <i>things</i>, and the marriage bed be
undefiled."</p>

<p>Then comes his exposure of my unhappy mistake:
"H. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER</span> mistakes the
adjective <i>feminine</i>
<span title="[Greek: en pasi]">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> as meaning <i>all men</i>." Really, had
I known that
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> was an adjective feminine, I could scarcely
have fallen into the mistake of supposing it to mean <i>all men</i>. But many
of your readers will be likely to feel some sympathy for my error, while
they learn from
C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> that the ordinary Greek grammars, in which they
can have proceeded but a very few pages before they read and were called
upon to repeat the cases of
<span title="[Greek: pas, pasa, pan]">&#960;&#945;&#962;, &#960;&#945;&#963;&#945;, &#960;&#945;&#957;</span>, were quite wrong in
teaching us that though
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> might be either masculine or
neuter, it must not be taken for a feminine form. But before we correct
this error in one of the first pages of our grammar, I presume that we
should all like to know from what recondite source
C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> has discovered
that
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#945;&#963;&#953;</span>, and not
<span title="[Greek: pasais]">&#960;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#953;&#962;</span>, is the feminine form of
this constantly-recurring adjective.</p>

<p>But farther, p. 193. will show that I did not give him a right to assume
that I should construe
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#945;&#963;&#953;</span> "all <i>men</i>." For under my
<i>mistaken</i> view of its being masculine, I thought the weaker sex was
included; and being myself a married man, I knew that marriage
comprehends women as well as men.</p>

<p>But there is still more to be learnt from the criticisms of
C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span>,
which the learned world never knew before. For, having told us that
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> is an adjective feminine, he adds, "it signifies here <i>in
all things</i>;" whereas the grammars have long taught that <i>things</i> must
not be understood unless the adjective be neuter. Perhaps he had better
concede that the grammars have not been wrong in allowing that
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> may be neuter; and then, as we know that it is also masculine, and
he knows it to be feminine, it must be admitted to be of all genders,
and so young learners will be spared all the trouble of distinguishing
between them. If it be admitted that
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> is neuter here, it
may signify <i>all things</i>.</p>

<p>My other mistake, he says, has been that of not perceiving that the
imperative <i>let</i> should be supplied, instead of the indicative <i>be</i>.
This must be allowed to be open to debate; but as the proper meaning of
<span title="[Greek: timios]">&#964;&#8055;&#956;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> is "to be esteemed honourable," "had in reputation"
(Acts v. 34.), will it be a mistake to say, that the primitive
Christians would properly respect marriage, in their clergy as well as
in others, on the ground of the Scriptures saying, "Let marriage be
esteemed honourably in every respect?" Could they properly want ground
for allowing it to the clergy, when they could also read 1 Tim. iii. 2.
11., and Titus i. 6.? As
C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> quotes the Vulgate for authority in
favour of <i>enim</i> in the next clause, he might have told your readers to
respect its authority in rendering the first clause, "Honorabile
connubium in omnibus." And if he has no new rules for correcting Syriac
as well as Greek, that very ancient version, though the gender of the
adjective be ambiguous in the equivalent to
<span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span>, renders the
next clause, "and <i>their</i> couch <i>is</i> pure," showing that <i>persons</i> were
understood.</p>

<p>Next comes K. S., who tells your readers that Whiston quotes the
well-known <i>Doctor</i> Wall for evidence as to the prohibition of second
marriages among the Greek clergy, before the Council of Nice. I should
like to know something of this <i>well-known Doctor</i>. There was a
well-known Mr. Wall, who wrote on baptism; and there was a Don Ricardo
Wall, a Spanish minister of state, well known in his day, and there was
a Governor Wall, too well known from his being hanged; but I cannot find
that any of these was a Doctor, so as to be the well-known Doctor Wall,
whose "authority no one would willingly undervalue," (p. 299.) As for
poor Whiston, his name was well known too, as a bye-word for a person
somewhat crazy, when he quitted those mathematical studies which
compelled him to fix his mind on his subject with steadiness whilst
pursuing them. K. S. has told us that he terms "the <i>Apostolic
Constitutions</i> the most sacred of the canonical books of the New
Testament." Such an opinion is quite enough as a test of Whiston's power
of judging in such questions. After much discussion, the most learned of
modern investigators assigns the compilation of the first six books of
those <i>Constitutions</i> to the end of the third century, and the eighth to
the middle of the fourth.</p>

<p>In the remarks to which C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> has thus adverted, I gave some evidence
of marriages among ecclesiastics, at later dates than your correspondent
supposes such to have been allowed. Can he disprove that evidence? (See
Vol. iv., p. 194.)</p>


 <p class="right">H<span class="smcap lowercase">ENRY</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER.</span></p>


<p>Your correspondent CEPHAS attacks the authorised version of Heb. xiii.
4., and favours your readers with another. I venture to offer a few
remarks on both these points.</p>

<p>I. He thinks&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "The authors of the authorised version advisedly<a id="Page_348"></a>  <span class="pagenum">[348]</span> inserted
   <i>is</i> instead of <i>let</i>, to forward their own new (?) doctrines."</p>


<p>Doubtless whatever the translators did was done "<i>advisedly</i>;" but what
proof has C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> that they adopted the present version <i>merely</i> to serve
their own "interest?" Some verb <i>must</i> be supplied, and either form will
suit the passage. It is true that Hammond prefers <i>let</i> to <i>is</i>, but
there is as great authority on the other side.</p>

<p class="blockquot">1. St. Chrysostom:</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "<i>For marriage is honourable, and the bed undefiled</i>: why art
   thou ashamed of the honourable; why blushest thou at the
   undefiled?"&mdash;<i>Hom. XII.</i> (Colos. vi.) Oxf. Trans., vol. xiv. p.
   330.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "<i>For marriage is honourable.</i>"&mdash;<i>Hom. X.</i> (1 Tim. i.), Oxf.
   Trans., vol. xii. p. 77.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"And this I say, not as accusing marriage; <i>for it is
   honourable</i>: but those who have used it amiss."&mdash;<i>Hom. IX.</i> (2
   Corin. iii.), Oxf. T., vol. xxvii. p. 120.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "And the blessed Paul says, '<i>Marriage is honourable in all, and
   the bed undefiled</i>;' but he has nowhere said, that the care of
   riches is honourable, but the reverse."&mdash;<i>Hom. V.</i> (Tit. ii.),
   Oxf. T., vol. xii. p. 313.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Thus marriage is accounted an honourable thing both by us and by
   those without; and <i>it is honourable</i>."&mdash;<i>Hom. XII.</i> (1 Cor.
   ii.), Oxf. T., vol. iv. p. 160.</p>


<p class="blockquot">2. St. Augustine:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Hear what God saith; not what thine own mind, in indulgence to
   thine own sins, may say, or what thy friend, thine enemy rather
   and his own too, bound in the same bond of iniquity with thee,
   may say. Hear then what the Apostle saith: '<i>Marriage is
   honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. But whoremongers and
   adulterers God will judge.</i>'"&mdash;<i>Hom. on N.T.</i>, Serm. xxxii. [82
   B], Oxf. T., vol. xvi. p. 263.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "'<i>Honourable, therefore, is marriage in all</i>, [he had just
   before been speaking of married persons] <i>and the bed
   undefiled.</i>' And this we do not so call a good, as that it is a
   good in comparison of fornication," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Short Treat. de Bono
   Conjug.</i>, Oxf. T., vol. xxii. p. 283.</p>


<p class="blockquot">3. St. Jerome, to whose authority perhaps C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> will sooner bow on a
version of Holy Scripture than to Hammond's:</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "Illi scriptum est: 'Honorabiles nuptiæ, et cubile immaculatum:'
   Tibi legitur, 'Fornicatores <i>autem</i> et adulteros judicabit
   Deus.'"&mdash;69. <i>Epist. ad Ocean. Hier. Op.</i>, vol. i. f. 325.
   Basileæ. Ed. Erasm. 1526.</p>


<p>In all these passages the words are quoted <i>affirmatively</i>, as is
evident from the context; and it seems more likely, as well as more
charitable, to believe that our translators were induced to adopt the
present version in deference to such authorities, than to impute to them
paltry motives of party purposes, which at the same time they have
themselves taken the surest means to get exposed, by printing the
inserted word in Italics. Can C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> adduce any Father who quotes the
text as he would read it, in the imperative mood, and with the sense of
"all things," not "all persons?" There may be such, but they require to
be alleged in the face of positive and adverse testimony. It is evident
that the mere substitution of <span title="[Greek: estô]">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#969;</span> for
 <span title="[Greek: esti]">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;</span>, without
an entire change of the rest of the passage, will make no difference;
for that which was an assertion before will then have become a command.</p>

<p>II. C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> proposes another version, and observes,
 "H. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER</span> mistakes
the adjective feminine <span title="[Greek: en pasi]">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> as meaning 'all men,' whereas it
signifies here 'in all things.'" Probably this is the first time that
MR. H. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER</span> and your other readers ever heard that
<span title="[Greek: en pasi]">&#7952;&#957; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span>
was a <i>feminine</i> adjective. Your learned critic must surely have either
forgotten his Greek grammar, in his haste to correct the translators of
the Bible, or else is not strong in the genders; for he has unluckily
hit upon the very gender which <span title="[Greek: pasi]">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span> cannot be, by any
possibility. But let it pass for a "lapsus memoriæ." However, he
supports his version of "all things" by one other passage, 2 Cor. xi.
6., where yet it <i>may</i> be translated, as Hammond himself does in the
margin, "among all men" (cf. v. 8.): and I will offer him one other:</p>

<p>But does C<span class="smcap lowercase">EPHAS</span> mean to say that

rendered, when found without a substantive? Here are five passages from

<p>Upon the whole, then, I imagine that if any one will take the trouble to
compare the passages above cited, and others in which the phrase

namely, <i>The Defense of the Apologie</i>, edit. fol. 1571, pp. 194-231,
540-545.; Wharton's <i>Treatise of the Celibacy of the Clergy</i>, in
Gibson's <i>Preservative against Popery</i>, fol. 1738, vol. i. pp. 278-339.;
and Preby. Payne's <i>Texts Examin'd</i>, &amp;c., in <i>the same</i>, pp. 340-359.
Previously, however, to commencing the study of these authorities, I
would recommend a perusal of the statement made by Messrs. Berington and
Kirk, on the celibacy of the clergy, in <i>The Faith of Catholics</i>, &amp;c.,
edit. 1830, p. 384.</p>

<h3>
<span>LORD STRAFFORD AND ARCHBISHOP USSHER.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 290.)</span>
</h3>


<p>The question raised by P<span class="smcap lowercase">EREGRINUS</span> is one of interest, which a comparison
of original and trustworthy writers enables us soon to settle. It is no
vulgar calumny which implicates Ussher in the advice which induced
Charles I. to consent to the murder of Lord Strafford; and though it
seems not unlikely that from timidity Ussher avoided giving any advice,
but allowed it to be inferred that he coincided in the counsel of
Williams; after weighing the evidence on this subject it is, to say the
least, impossible for us to believe for an instant that he acted in the
same noble manner as Bishop Juxon. Thus far is clear, that Bishop Juxon,
knowing that the king was satisfied of the innocence of Lord Strafford,
besought him to refuse to allow of the execution, and to "trust God with
the rest." Neither is it denied that Bishops Williams, Potter, and
Morton advised the king to assent to the bill of attainder, on the
ground that he was only assenting to the deeds of others, and was not
himself acting responsibly. And assuredly the same evidence which
carries us thus far, will not allow of our supposing that Ussher joined
with Juxon, though, as I have said before, he may, when summoned, have
avoided giving any advice. The facts seem simply these: when it was
known that the king, satisfied of the innocence of Lord Strafford,
hesitated about affixing his signature to the bill, or granting a
commission to others to do so, the London rabble, lord mayor, and
prentice lads were next called up, and the safety of the royal family
menaced. This led to the queen's solicitation, that Charles would regard
the lives of his family and sacrifice Strafford. Still the king could
not be moved. He had scruples of conscience, as well he might. This the
peers knowing, they <i>selected</i> four bishops who should satisfy these
scruples: the four thus selected were Ussher, Williams, Morton, and
Potter. On Sunday morning, the 9th of May, the <i>four</i> should have
proceeded to Whitehall: the <i>three</i> latter did so; but Ussher preferred
the safer course of going and preaching at St. Paul's, Covent Garden,
leaving to his brother bishops the task of distinguishing between the
king's private conscience and his corporate one. The king, not satisfied
to leave the matter in the hands of those specially selected to urge his
consent, summoned the Privy Council. Juxon was present as Lord
Treasurer, and gave that noble and truly Christian advice: "Sir, you
know the judgment of your own conscience; I beseech you follow that, and
trust God with the rest." Moved by this, and by his own conviction of
Strafford's innocence, the king still refused assent; and it was needful
to hold another meeting, which was done in the evening of the same day.
As evening service had not been introduced into churches, Ussher was
present at the palace, and by his silence acquiesced in the advice
tendered by Bishop Williams. After the bill was signed, he broke silence
in useless regrets. But it was then too late to benefit Strafford, and
quite safe to utter his own opinions. In opposition to this, which rests
upon indisputable evidence, and with which Ussher's own statement
entirely accords, P<span class="smcap lowercase">EREGRINUS</span> adduces the fact that Ussher attended
Strafford on the scaffold. But what does this prove? Merely that the
faction which would not tolerate that Laud or Juxon should minister the
last offices of the Church to their dying friend, did not object to
Ussher's presence; and that Strafford, who could have known nothing of
what had passed on Sunday in the interior of Whitehall, gladly accepted
the consolations of religion from the hands of the timid Primate of all
Ireland.<a id="Page_350"></a>  <span class="pagenum">[350]</span></p>

<p>The substance of what appears in Elrington's <i>Life of Ussher</i> had been
long before stated by Dr. Thomas Smith in his <i>Vita Jacobi Usserii</i>,
apud <i>Vitæ quorundam Erudit. et Illust. Virorum</i>; but if, in addition,
P<span class="smcap lowercase">EREGRINUS</span> would consult May's <i>History of the Long Parliament</i>;
Echard's <i>History of England</i>, bk. ii. ch. i.; Whitelocke's <i>Memorials</i>,
p. 45.; Rushworth; Collier's <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, t. ii. p. 801.;
Dr. Knowler, in Preface to <i>The Earl of Strafford's Letters and
Dispatches</i>; Dr. South, in <i>Sermon on Rom</i>. xi. 33.; and Sir George
Radcliffe's Essay in Appendix to <i>Letters, &amp;c. of Lord Strafford</i>, t.
ii. p. 432., I doubt not but that he will come to the conclusion that
the above sketch is only consistent with stern fact.</p>

<h3>
<span>SCULPTURED STONES IN THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 86.)</span>
</h3>


<p>A<span class="smcap lowercase">BERDONIENSIS</span> tells us that Mr. Chalmers, of Auldbar, had got drawings
of the sculptured stone obelisks in Angus lithographed for the Bannatyne
Club, and that the work had excited considerable interest, and that the
Spalding Club of Aberdeen are now obtaining drawings of the stones of
this description in the north of Scotland. Circulars from the Spalding
Club desiring information had been sent to a large number of the clergy,
to which answers had been received only from a small portion, and he
desired further information. These monuments, he states, are not to be
found south of the Forth, and I am told not further north than
Sutherlandshire. It would be desirable to know what these sculptured
obelisks and the sculptures on them are; if symbolical, of what, or what
they serve to illustrate; the supposed race and date to which they are
referable. What the Veronese antiquarians, Maffei and Bianchini, did
from the nation's ancient remains to throw light on history, shows what
may be done. In Orkney no sculptured stone, or stone with a runic
inscription, has been noticed among its circles of standing stones, or
single bantasteins; and though it is right to admit that attention has
not been directed to seeking them, yet I do not believe they could have
escaped observation had there been any such. The absence of runic stones
in Orkney appears singular in a country certainly Scandinavian from its
conquest by Harald Harfager, king of Norway, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 895 (or perhaps
earlier), till its transfer to Scotland in 1468 in mortgage for a part
of the marriage portion of the Danish princess who became the queen of
James III. of Scotland by treaty between the countries of Denmark and
Norway and Scotland. In Zetland Dr. Hibbert noticed a few ruins, and
within these few days the peregrinations of the Spalding Club have
brought to notice, in the Island of Bruray, a stone of runic state,
having inscribed on it letters like runic characters, and sculptures in
relief, but decayed. A drawing is being made of it, to satisfy
antiquarian curiosity. It may merit notice that <i>no</i> runic stones have
been found in Orkney, nor circles of standing stones in Zetland. The
sculptures of classic antiquity have been made use of to elucidate
history, and it is equally to be desired that those Scottish sculptured
remains should, if possible, be rescued from what Sir Francis Palgrave
calls the "speechless past," and made to tell their tale in illustration
of the earlier period of Scottish or Caledonian story.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE LOCUSTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 255.)</span>
</h3>


<p>The Romaic version of Matt. iv. 4. is almost verbally taken from the
Greek, "<span title="[Greek: hê de trophê autou
ên akrides kai meli agrion]">&#7969; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8052;
 &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;
 &#7974;&#957; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;
 &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#953;
 &#7940;&#947;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>." In Mark
i. 6., the expression is <span title="[Greek: esthiôn akridas]">&#7952;&#963;&#952;&#8055;&#969;&#957;
 &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#945;&#962;</span>. The only other place
in the New Testament were the word <span title="[Greek: akris]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8054;&#962;</span> is found, is in Rev.
ix. 3. 7., where it plainly means a locust.</p>

<p>In the Septuagint version the word is commonly used for the Hebrew <span title="[Hebrew: &#700;arbeh]">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span>,
locust, of the meaning of which there is no dispute; as in Exodus, x. 4.
12, 13, 14.; Deut. xxviii. 38.; Joel, i. 4., ii. 25.; Ps. cv. 34., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In other places the word <span title="[Greek: akris]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8054;&#962;</span> in the Septuagint corresponds to
<span title="[Hebrew: châgab]">&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1489;</span>, in the Hebrew, as in Numb. xiii.
33.; Is. xl. 22.; and that this was a species of locust which was
eatable, appears from Lev. xi. 21, 22.:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Yet there may ye eat of every <i>flying</i> creeping thing that goeth
   upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal
   upon the earth; even those of them ye may eat,
the locust (<span title="[Hebrew: th hâ&#700;arbeh]">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: ton brouchon]">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span>) after his kind, and the
   bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and
   the grasshopper (<span title="[Hebrew: &#700;eth hechâgab]">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514; &#1492;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1489;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: tên akrida]">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#945;</span>) after his
   kind."</p>


<p>That locusts were eaten in the East is plain from Pliny, who in xi. 29.
relates this of the Parthians; and in vi. 30. of the Ethiopians, among
whom was a tribe called the Acridophagi, from their use of the
<span title="[Greek: akris]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8054;&#962;</span> for food.</p>

<p>There seems, then, no reason to suppose that in Matt. iv. 4., Mark i.
6., the word <span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> should be taken to mean anything but
locusts.</p>

<p>It was, however, a very ancient opinion that the word
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>
here means
<span title="[Greek: akrodrya]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8057;&#948;&#961;&#965;&#945;</span>, or
<span title="[Greek: akra dryôn]">&#7940;&#954;&#961;&#945; &#948;&#961;&#8059;&#969;&#957;</span>, or
<span title="[Greek: akremones]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8051;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span>, or
<span title="[Greek: akrismata]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, the ends of the branches of trees;
although the word
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> is never used in this sense by pure
Greek writers.</p>

<p>The interpretation of
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> (Matt. iii. 4.) suggested to
<span title="[Greek: Boreas]">&#914;&#959;&#961;&#8051;&#945;&#962;</span> is not new. Isidorus Pelusiota (Epist. i. 132.) says:</p>

 &#966;&#965;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span>."</p>


<p>Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others, either adopt or quote the same
interpretation, as may be seen by referring to Suicer, <i>Thes. Eccl.</i>,
under the word
<span title="[Greek: Akris]">&#7944;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>But in the absence of any direct proof that the word was ever used in
this sense, I do not think it safe to adopt interpretations which
possibly rested only on some tradition.</p>

<p>There is positive proof that locusts were eaten by some people. In Lev.
xi. 22. we have,</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "These of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the
   bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and
   the grasshopper after his kind."</p>


<p>In this passage we find
<span title="[Greek: akrida]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#945;</span> used by the LXX.
for the Hebrew
<span title="[Hebrew: châgab]">&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1489;</span>, the last of the four kinds specified. I find in several
commentators whom I have consulted, reference to Bochart's
<i>Hierozoicon</i>, ii. 4. 7., but as I have not the book by me, I must be
content with referring your correspondent to it; and if he will look at
the commentaries of Elsner and Kuinoel, and Schleusner's <i>Lexicon</i>, he
will find references to so many authors in confirmation of the fact in
question, that I think he will not disagree with me in concluding that
where the balance of learned opinion, as well as of evidence, is so
great in favour of one interpretation, we ought not rashly to take up
another, however intelligent the party may be by whom it was suggested.</p>

<p>I have just looked into Wolfius on the New Testament, and there find a
list of writers who
<a id="Page_352"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[352]</span> have adopted the interpretations of the
Father above mentioned, and also a host of others who defend the
received explanation. If they should be within the reach of
<span title="[Greek: Boreas]">&#914;&#959;&#961;&#8051;&#945;&#962;</span> (as most of them are not in mine), he will be able to balance
their arguments for himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps the following may be useful to your correspondent

<p>Lev. xi. 22., we have an enumeration of the various kinds of locusts
known to the Jews, viz. the locust proper, the bald locust, beetle,
grasshopper; rendered in the Vulgate respectively, <i>bruchus</i>, <i>attacus</i>,
<i>ophiomachus</i>, <i>locusta</i>, the latter by the Septuagint,

<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>, rendered by Fuerstius (<i>Heb. Conc.</i>) <i>locusta gregaria</i>, is
mostly used as implying diminutiveness, as Numbers, xiii. 33., and but
once as a devouring insect, 2 Chro. vii. 13. It is translated
indiscriminately, in our version, <i>locust</i> and <i>grasshopper</i>; all these
were edible and permitted to the Jews. Singularly enough, there is one
passage in which this word
<span title="[Hebrew: châgab]">&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;&#1463;&#1489;</span> is used, viz. Eccl. xii. 5., in
which it is doubted by some whether it may not mean a vegetable; but
this is not the opinion of the best authorities. The observation of
Grotius, by-the-bye, on the place is extremely curious, differing from
all the other commentators.</p>

<p>What we learn from the Old Testament, then is the probability that
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> meant a smaller kind of locust; and that they were
edible and permitted to the Jews. We have abundant evidence, moreover,
from other quarters, that these locusts were prized as food by
frequenters of the desert. Joh. Leo (<i>Descript. Africæ</i>, book ix.,
quoted by Drusius, <i>Crit. Sac.</i>) says:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"Arabiæ desertæ et Libyæ populi locustarum adventum pro felici
   habent omine; nam vel elixas, vel ad solem desiccatas, in farinam
   tundunt atque edunt."</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Refert Agatharchides, in libro de Mare Rubro,

<p class="noindent">Fit food, therefore, of the ascetic. Theophylact understood by
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> a wild herb or fruit; but all the most trustworthy commentators
besides were of opinion that an animal was intended.</p>

<p>The modern Greek interpretation of
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>, "the young and
tender shoots of plants," may perhaps be traced in what Balth.

<p>The following from <i>Hieron. adv. Jovinian</i>, ii. 6., quoted by Drusius,
while it asserts that locusts were esteemed as food in some countries,
will, perhaps, account for the unwillingness of the Greek friend of your
correspondent
<span title="[Greek: Boreas]">&#914;&#959;&#961;&#8051;&#945;&#962;</span> to recognise an animal in the
<span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> of John the Baptist:</p>

<p>Will you permit me to observe that the proper word is <i>locusts</i>? For I
remember when I was at Constantinople in the year 1809, that passing
through the fruit and vegetable bazaar, I observed some dried fruits,
resembling a large French bean pod; they appeared dry, and were of a
brown colour. I inquired the name of "the fruit;" I was told they were
"locusts." I was struck with the name, for I remembered the passage in
the New Testament, and I could not reconcile my mind to St. John living
upon locusts (the insects) and wild honey. I immediately tasted some of
the fruit, and found it sweet and good, something similar to the date,
but not so good, although nutritious. I was thus instantly convinced of
the possibility of St. John living upon "locusts and wild honey" in the
desert. I have related to you this fact as it occurred to me. The locust
tree must be well known amongst horticulturists. I do not pretend to
enter into the question whether the translation is right or wrong, as I
am no "scollard," as the old woman said.</p>


 <p class="right">J. B<span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span></p>


<p>There is in Malta, the north of Africa, and Syria, a tree called the
locust tree; it bears a pod resembling the bean, and affords in those
countries food for both man and horse, which I have no doubt in my own
mind is the locust of the New Testament. If your correspondent feels
curious on the subject, I would search the bottom of my portmanteau, and
perhaps might be able to forward him a specimen.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE SOUL'S ERRAND.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 274.)</span>
</h3>


<p>This beautiful little poem is assigned by Bishop Percy to Sir Walter
Raleigh, by whom it is said to have been written the night before his
execution; this assertion is, however, proved to be unfounded, from the
fact that Raleigh was not executed until 1618, and the poem in question
was printed in the second edition of Francis Davidson's <i>Poetical
Rhapsody</i>, in 1608. "It is nevertheless possible," observes Sir Harris
Nicolas (Introduction to <i>Poetical Rhapsody</i>, p. ci.), "that it was
written by Raleigh the night before he <i>expected</i> to have been executed
at Winchester, November, 1603, a circumstance which is perfectly
reconcileable to dates, and in some degree accounts for the tradition
alluded to." This ground must be now abandoned, as it is certain that
MS. copies of the poem exist of a still earlier date. Malone had a MS.
copy of it dated 1595 (<i>Shakspeare by Boswell</i>, vol. ii. p. 579.);
Brydges speaks of one in the British Museum dated 1596 (<i>Lee Priory
edit. of Raleigh's Works</i>, vol. viii. p. 725.); and Campbell says, "it
can be traced to a MS. of a date as early as 1593" (<i>Specimens</i>, p. 57.
second edit.).</p>

<p>"The Soul's Errand" is found in the folio edition of Joshua Sylvester's
<i>Works</i>, and also in the poems of Lord Pembroke. Ritson, whose authority
merits some attention, peremptorily attributes it to Francis Davison.
"<i>The Answer to the Lye</i>," he observes, "usually ascribed to Raleigh,
and pretended to have been written the night before his execution, was
in fact by Francis Davison" (<i>Bib. Poet.</i> p. 308.).</p>

<p>The evidence in favour of these three claimants has been well examined
by the Rev. John Hannah (see <i>Poems by Sir Henry Wotton, Sir Walter
Raleigh, and others</i>, 12mo. 1845, pp. 89-99.), and completely set aside.
The same gentleman has printed a curious poetical piece, from an old MS.
Miscellany in the Chetham Library at Manchester (8012. p. 107), which
does something to establish Raleigh's claim. It commences as follows:&mdash;</p>



<div class="poem">

<p>"Go, Eccho of the minde; </p>
<p>A careles troth protest; </p>
<p>Make answere    y<span class="topnum">t</span> <i>rude</i> </p>
<p><i>Rawly</i> No stomack can disgest."</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquot"> "In these verses (remarks Mr. Hannah) three points especially
   deserve attention; first, that they assign the disputed poem to
   Raleigh <i>by name</i>; next, that they were written <i>when he was
   still alive</i>, as is plain from the concluding stanza; and lastly,
   that they give the reason why it has been found so difficult to
   discover its true author, for the 13th stanza intimates that 'The
   Lie' was anonymous, though its writer was not altogether
   unknown."</p>


<p>Many MS. copies of "The Soul's Errand" exist. Two of them have been
printed at the end of Sir Harris Nicolas's edition of Davison's
<i>Poetical Rhapsody</i>; the one from Harl. MS. 2296., the other from a
manuscript in the same collection, No. 6910.; the readings of which not
only differ materially from each other, but in a slight degree also from
the printed copies. The title in Davison is "The Lie," which is retained
by Percy; that of "The Soul's Errand" was taken by Ellis from
Sylvester's <i>Works</i>. In some copies it is called "The Farewell."</p>

<p>The lines reported to have been written by Sir Walter Raleigh the night
before his execution were <i>not</i>, I think, those alluded to by ÆGROTUS.
In the <i>Reliquiæ Wottonianæ</i> are some few "poems found amongst the
papers of Sir Henry Wotton," one of which is headed "Sir Walter Raleigh
the Night before his Death," and is this:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p>"Even such is <i>time</i> that takes on trust</p>
     <p class="i1">Our <i>youth</i>, our <i>joyes</i>, our all we have,</p>
     <p>And pays us but with <i>age</i> and <i>dust</i>;</p>
     <p class="i1">Who in the dark and silent grave</p>
     <p>(When we have wandered all our ways)</p>
     <p>Shuts up the story of our days.</p>
     <p>But from this <i>earth</i>, this <i>grave</i>, this <i>dust</i>,</p>
     <p>My God shall raise me up, I trust."&mdash;W. R.</p>

     <p class="author">  P. 396, 3d edition, London, 1672.</p>

</div>

<p>In the <i>Collection of Sacred Poetry</i>, edited for the Parker Society by
Mr. Farr (vol. i. p. 236.), the lines I have adduced are headed "An
Epitaph" and attributed to Sir W. Raleigh on the above melancholy
occasion.</p>

<p>"The Soul's Errand," which Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> quotes from, is entitled "The
Farewell" in the same collection; but so much ambiguity rests upon Sir
Walter's poetry that I shall merely add my conviction that the "Epitaph"
is only a fragment&mdash;"judicent peritiores."</p>

<p>&mdash;An instance
of what may be considered as an early example of a book-plate, occurs
pasted upon the fly-leaf of a MS. in the College amongst Philpot's
<i>Collections</i> (marked P. e. 15.), being an engraving of a blank shield,
with a helmet and lambrequin, and a compartment for the motto; the whole
surrounded by a border ornamented with flowers; altogether well
engraved. The shield contains six quarterings, very neatly sketched with
pen and ink; and the helmet is surmounted by a crest, also neatly
sketched. In the upper part of the border, occupying a space evidently
intended to be filled up, is the autograph of "Joseph Holand;" while a
similar space in the lower part contains the date of "1585" in the same
hand, in which also the motto "Fortitudo mea Deus," is written within
the compartment above mentioned. The following, which is a collateral
proof of the age of the book-plate, is likewise an autograph title to
the MS.:</p>


<p class="blockquot">"In this booke are conteyned the armes of the nobylytye of

rarities."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Moonlight</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 273.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The effects of the moonlight on animal
matter is well known to the inhabitants of warm climates. I remember
that when I resided in Bermuda, if the meat (which was usually hung out
at night) was exposed to the rays of the moon it putrified directly. I
was frequently cautioned by the inhabitants to beware of the moon
shining upon me when asleep, as it caused the most dangerous and
virulent fevers. Another curious power of the moonlight was that of
developing temporary blindness, caused by the glare of the sun on bright
objects. I have often seen persons stumbling and walking as quite blind,
in a moonlight so bright I could see to read by; these were principally
soldiers who had been employed during the day working on the fort and on
the white stone. On hearing the surgeon of the regiment mention that
two-thirds of the men were troubled with it, causing a greater amount of
night-work as sentries to the few who were able to see at night, I
suggested to him the following plan mentioned in a story I had read many
years before in <i>Blackwood</i>:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"A pirate ship in those latitudes was several times nearly
   captured, owing to all the men being moon-blind at night; the
   captain ordered all his men to bind up one eye during the day,
   and by this means they could see with that eye to navigate the
   ship at night."</p>

<p>My friend the surgeon tried the experiment, and found bandaging the eyes
at night, and giving them complete rest, restored in time their sight at
moonlight.</p>

      <p class="right">M. E. C. T.</p>

<p>That the light of the moon accelerates putrefaction is more than an
unfounded popular opinion. I have heard it repeatedly asserted by
observant and sober-minded naval officers as a fact, established by
experience in tropical climates. Their constant testimony was, that when
there is no moon the fresh meat is hung over the stern of the ship at
night for coolness; but if this is done when the moon shines, the meat
becomes unfit to eat.</p>

<p>The Query will probably elicit an answer from some one able to speak
more directly upon the subject. It well deserves further inquiry.</p>

midnight? I turn to Herschel's <i>Outlines of Astronomy</i> (p. 86.), and I
find that astronomers (without any limitation) commenced their day at
noon. Sir John Herschel is inclined to think that it would be better to
commence at midnight with the world at large. Surely if the foreign
astronomers <i>already did this</i>, he would not have failed to cite their
example, and to remind the English astronomers that they stood alone;
but of this he does not give the smallest hint.</p>


 <p class="right"> A L<span class="smcap lowercase">EARNER.</span></p>


<p>Your correspondent D<span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span> is mistaken in supposing that "foreigners
ordinarily commence the astronomical day at midnight."</p>

<p>With respect to France, in the <i>Explication et Usage des Articles de la
Connaissance des Temps</i> it is expressly stated: "Le jour astronomique
<i>commence à midi</i>."</p>

<p>And in the explanation appended to the <i>Berlin Jahrbuch</i>, it is in like
manner distinctly laid down:</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "The time which must be always understood, unless it is otherwise
   particularly expressed, is the mean time of the meridian of the
   New Berlin Observatory, which is taken to be 44<span class="topnum">m</span> 14·0<span class="topnum">s</span> eastward
   of Paris, and 53<span class="topnum">m</span> 35·5<span class="topnum">s</span> eastward of Greenwich. <i>The beginning
   of the day is at noon.</i>"</p>


<p>The <i>civil</i> day always commences at the midnight preceding this
<i>astronomical</i> day.</p>

<p>It follows that Sept. 17, 3<span class="topnum">h</span> 40<span class="topnum">m</span> 30<span class="topnum">s</span> Greenwich mean time, is simply
Sept. 17, 4<span class="topnum">h</span> 34<span class="topnum">m</span> 5·5<span class="topnum">s</span> Berlin mean time.

<h4>
<span><i>Ruined Churches</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 261.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The old church of St. John in
the Wilderness, near Exmouth, can hardly be said to be <i>in ruins</i>, in
the sense before implied with regard to marriages, &amp;c. It is
<i>dilapidated</i>, and almost deserted; but on visiting it a few days since,
I found it securely locked, the nave weather tight, and sufficiently
furnished for baptisms, marriages, and burials, with surplice, two
Prayer Books, Bible, table, font, bier, and bell. They had certainly all
seen their best days; but on that account perhaps they are supposed to
be more in keeping with the general state of the venerable fabric.<a id="Page_356"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[356]</span>
</p>

<p>It is, in fact, the mother church of others in the vicinity, which are
only chapels of ease; but as the population increased around them, and
fell away, from some cause or other, from the precincts of the old
church, it seems to have been deserted and dismantled of everything but
what is barely necessary for burials, and an occasional wedding and
baptism. It is the south aisle only which has been removed, and that by
authority, many years ago; but certainly, it has on that side, and from
the want of glass in the fine tower window, a desolate and ruinous
appearance. In the churchyard there is a most venerable specimen of a
noble yew-tree.</p>

<span><i>Italian Writer on Political Economy&mdash;Death of Carli</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 175.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It is inquired, "What was the first work by an Italian writer on
any element of political economy? and in what year did Carli, the
celebrated economist, die?" The latter question I at once answer by
stating that it was on the 22d of February, 1795, in his seventy-fifth
year, having been born at Cape d'Istria, an episcopal town of Illyria,
April, 1720, of a noble family. His collected works, embracing almost
the <i>omne scibile</i>, were published in 1784-1794, nineteen octavo
volumes, at Milan, <i>Delle Opere del Signor Gianrinaldo Conte Carli,
Presidente Emerito del Supremo Conciglio di Pubblica Economia, &amp;c.</i> The
first publication, confined to fifteen volumes, was extended to nineteen
by him, <i>Delle Antichità Italiche, con Appendice, de' Documenti, &amp;c.</i>,
1793-1795. Few writers have exceeded him in the variety of his subjects,
which combined the drama, poetry, translations, history, philosophy, the
monetary system, political economy, &amp;c. As to your correspondent
 A<span class="smcap lowercase">LPHA'S</span>
first inquiry, it will be satisfactorily answered by consulting the
collection printed at Milan in 1803, <i>Scrittori Classici Italiani</i>,
first volume of the fifty in 8vo., to which the entire extend up to that
period, since when several have appeared.</p>

Goar, <i>Rituale Græcum</i>; Du Cange's <i>Glossary</i>; and, <i>Ferrarius de Re

432.; vol. iii. p. 71.; likewise at Bishop Challoner's <i>Garden of the
Soul</i>, pp. x. 123. (edit. 1824); and, if he have a full abundance of
leisure, with sufficient resolution to abandon it to an undertaking so
pregnant with instructiveness, let him too, by all means, "explore with
curious search" the controversial writings of the early periods of
Puritanism, on the sadly vexed question of the habits of the clergy, to
which he will find abundant reference in all our Anglican church
histories.</p>

  <div class="stanza">

     <p>Past eight o'clock! O Herrnhuth, do thou ponder:</p>
     <p> Eight souls in Noah's ark were living yonder.</p>
     <p> 'Tis nine o'clock: ye brethren, hear it striking;</p>
     <p>  Keep hearts and houses clean, to our Saviour's liking.</p>
     <p>Now brethren, hear, the clock is ten and passing:</p>
     <p>None rest but such as wait for Christ embracing.</p>
     <p> Eleven is past! still at this hour of eleven,</p>
     <p>The Lord is calling us from earth to heaven.</p>
     <p>    Ye, brethren, hear, the midnight clock is humming:</p>
     <p>  At midnight our great Bridegroom will be coming.</p>
     <p>Past one o'clock! the day breaks out of darkness;</p>
     <p> Great morning star appear, and break our hardness!</p>
     <p>   'Tis two! on Jesus wait this silent season,</p>
     <p> Ye two so near related, Will and Reason.</p>
     <p> The clock is three! the blessed Three doth merit</p>
     <p> The best of praise, from body, soul, and spirit.</p>
     <p> 'Tis four o'clock, when three make supplication</p>
     <p> The Lord will be the fourth on that occasion.</p>
     <p> Five is the clock! five virgins were discarded,</p>
     <p>When five with wedding garments were rewarded.</p>
     <p>   The clock is six, and I go off my station;</p>
     <p> Now, brethren, <i>watch yourselves for your salvation</i>.</p>

<span><i>The Aneroid Barometer</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 295.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The intended signification
of this name, "aneroid," can of course be only determined by the person
who conferred it; upon any less direct authority the derivation quoted
from Mr. Dent's description can scarcely be received. The meaning<a id="Page_357"></a>
<span class="pagenum">[357]</span> of
<span title="[Greek: nêros]">&#957;&#951;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span>
 is <i>moist</i>, rather than <i>fluid</i>; but even
admitting the latter signification, then the last syllable ought surely
to be referred, not to
<span title="[Greek: eidos]">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>, but to its root
<span title="[Greek: eidô]">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#969;</span>
(scio); <i>perceivable without fluid</i> being a much better characteristic
than <i>a form without fluid</i>.</p>

<p>But taking into consideration the peculiar construction of this sort of
barometer, its flexible diaphragm supported from within against the
pressure of the atmosphere, may not its name have been derived from
<span title="[Greek: ana]">&#7936;&#957;&#8048;</span> (adversus),
<span title="[Greek: aêr]">&#7936;&#8052;&#961;</span> (aer), and

<p><i>The Chronological New Testament, in which the Text of the Authorised
Version is newly divided into Paragraphs and Sections, with the Dates
and Places of Transactions marked, the Marginal Renderings of the
Translators, many Parallel Illustrative Passages printed at length,
brief Introductions to each Book, and a Running Analysis of the
Epistles</i>, is another and most praiseworthy attempt "to make our
invaluable English version more intelligible to devout students of the
Word of God," by the various helps in arrangement and printing set forth
in the ample title-page which we have just transcribed. All such
endeavors to increase that "knowledge which maketh wise unto salvation"
carry within themselves the elements of success; and we shall be the
more glad to find that the present work meets with the patronage it
deserves, as we may then look for the Old Testament on the same plan.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who remember the parallel which Bishop Ken drew
between himself and</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>Bless'd Gregory, whose patriarchal height</p>
   <p>Shed on the Eastern sphere celestial light,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and who may desire to read the life of him whom that great ornament of
our Church chose for his model, will thank us for drawing their
attention to <i>Gregory of Nazianzum&mdash;a Contribution to the Ecclesiastical
History of the Fourth Century</i>, by Professor Ullman of Heidelberg, which
has just been translated by Mr. G. V. Cox. The translator has for the
present confined himself to that part of Dr. Ullman's volume which
relates to the life of Gregory, and is therefore more attractive to the
general reader; the dogmatic part, or the statements and examination of
Gregory's theological opinions, being for the present withheld. In this
we think Mr. Cox has done wisely, since we have no doubt that the
present volume will be read with great interest by many who will gladly
dwell upon the life and practice of this distinguished Father of the
Church, but who would be turned aside from its perusal, from their
unwillingness or inability to enter upon any such investigation as is
implied in the critical examination of Gregory's theological opinions.</p>

<p>We have again to thank Dr. Latham for an important contribution towards
a proper knowledge of our own tongue; and it would be difficult to point
out a more successful combination of ethnological and philological
knowledge than is exhibited in his newly-published <i>Hand-book of the
English Language, for the Use of Students of the Universities and Higher
Classes of Schools</i>. We cannot of course enter into any analysis of a
work which is as replete with interest and amusement as it is with
instruction; but we may point out as peculiarly deserving of attention
the first part, which treats of the Germanic origin of the English
language; and the second, which treats of its history and analysis. We
are glad to see Dr. Latham's view of the Frisian share in the invasion
of this country.</p>

<p>The commendations so universally bestowed upon Mr. Grant for the
research, accuracy, and picturesque interest displayed in his <i>Memorials
of the Castle of Edinburgh</i>, and his <i>Memoirs of Sir W. Kirkaldy of
Grange</i>, may be extended to him for his <i>Memoirs and Adventures of Sir
John Hepburn, Knight, Governor of Munich, Marshal of France under Louis
XIII., and Commander of the Scots Brigade under Gustavus Adolphus</i>. He
has on this, as on former occasions, the advantage of a new and
interesting subject; and by grouping round his hero&mdash;whose conduct and
bravery won for him the reputation of being esteemed the best of that
warlike age, next to Gustavus himself&mdash;all the great leaders in that
struggle for the liberties of Germany, the Thirty Years' War&mdash;he has
produced a volume which will be read with great interest, not only for
the picture it exhibits of the distinguished soldier of fortune who
forms its immediate subject, but also for its record of the services of
the Scottish troops who served in the German wars under Gustavus
Adolphus.</p>

<p><i>A Little Earnest Book upon a Great Old Subject</i>, in which Mr. Wilson
endeavors to pourtray the thoughts and feelings of the poet, will be
read with pleasure by all who agree with him that poetry rightly
understood is associated with everything that is eternal and just, true
and elevating, tender and loving. It is a little book of quaint and
pleasant thoughts, quaintly got up, and beautifully illustrated.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell, of Bond Street, announces a beautifully illustrated work
on <i>The Parables of our Saviour</i>, to be engraved in the line manner by
the best artists from the designs of Franklin.</p>

<p>The Sales of Books, &amp;c., those heralds of the coming winter, are
beginning. Messrs. Puttick and Simpson commence this day a six days'
sale of valuable books removed from the country, including many curious
and rare works. On Monday Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will commence
their season by selling a portion of the valuable library of a gentleman
deceased, which will occupy them for four days; and on Monday and the
fifteen following days Messrs. Foster and Son will be engaged in the
disposal of that matchless series of examples of Mediæval Architecture,
and of other objects of decorative art, remarkable alike for their
beauty, rarity, and historical value, so long known as the <i>Cottingham
Museum</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
